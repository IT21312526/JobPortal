# JobPortal
Job portal is a mobile application which helps to overcome unemployment in our country. Due to the economic crisis lots of youths are unemployed and they are looking for some jobs or they are willing to do some freelancing works. Since this is a major problem in our country, we have decided to build a mobile application which will be more helpful to unemployed people. Using our application companies and organizations can advertise their openings for several jobs. These job offers will be displayed to our users and they can apply to those jobs using the application. Also, users can advertise their freelance services in our application. These services will be displayed to companies and organizations which will help them to hire some freelancers for their projects. Our application will review companies before allowing them to publish their job offers. At the same time freelance services will also be reviewed before publishing. This is mainly to prevent users from posting inappropriate jobs and services. Using our application all the unemployed people around the country will be able to apply for the vacancies around the country. And also, they can get work for their freelance services and they can earn money from it. This will help our country to overcome the unemployment problem that we are currently facing.
